 - when going from level to level, the "revealed_tiles" are forgotten
    (this is because we save the map only after it's newly generated, and on on
    level change)

 - with 100.0 gold, buying rations for 0.4 results in having 99.5 gold left (due
   to stats? possibly?)

 - gamelog messages are missing for many of the effects

 - when buying scrolls from vendors, it takes 1 move to identify the items

 - identify buildings with letters (or other means) when revealing the town map

 - work out how to combine all the menu functions in gui.rs to remove duplicate
   code

 - particle effects affect tooltip tips
